# PlugMan
PlugMan is a Minecraft Paper Plugin that allows you to manage and download new plugins all in-game.
### Features:
- Enable and Disable Plugins: /toggle [Plugin], /disableall, /enableall
- Edit and Delete Config files of other Plugins: /setconfig [PluginName] [Key] [Value]
- Download Plugins via URL: /downloadPlugin [URL] [FileName.jar]
- Reload Plugins: /reloadPlugin [Pluginname/*]
- View What Plugins you have installed (Only Discord Bot): /plugins
- Upload locally stored plugins (Only Discord Bot): /uploadPlugin [File] [FileName.jar]
### Discord:
To use a DiscordBot you have to
1. Create your Bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create the token.txt file in Server/plugins/PlugMan/
3. Paste the Bot Token into the Text file
4. Restart/Reload your Server and test it out

Currently, Only Users with the Administrator Permission or the Role "PluginPerms"(You have to create this one yourself, I recommend turning off all permissions and putting it at the bottom of the role list) can use Discord Commands.\
### NOTE: Using a Discord Bot is Optional, you don't have to use one.
